EII VA Serving Microservice
===========================

The EII VA Serving (EVAS) Microservice wraps the Intel Video Analytics Serving
library to provide an EII visual ingestion and analytics module utilizing the
features and functionality of the library.

## Building

The Docker container for this service cannot be built by itself. It must be
built in the context of the EII multi-repo project. Follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests).

Since the model files are large in size, they are not part of the repo.
Download the required model files to be used for the pipeline mentioned in 
[config](./config.json) by referring https://github.com/intel/video-analytics-serving/tree/master/tools/model_downloader
and have the downloaded model files placed in "/opt/intel/eii/models" 
directory.

```sh
# Execute the builder.py script
$ python3 buidler.py -f evas.yml

# Create some necessary items for the service
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/intel/eii/models/

# Build the docker containers
$ docker-compose build

# Start the docker containers
$ docker-compose up -d
```

This repository provides the VA Serving pipeline needed for using a URI source
and sending the ingested frames using the EII MsgBus Publisher. The commands above
which create the, "models/", directory and the, "pipelines/", install needed
directories for the service to run and install the VA Serving pipeline.

## Configuration

Please see the `config.json` file for the configuration of the service. The
default configuration will start the object_detection demo for EII.

The table below describes each of the configuration attributes currently
supported.

> **TODO:** Need to document these parameters much more.

|      Parameter      |                                                     Description                                                |
| :-----------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source`            | Source of the frames, must be `"gstreamer"` or `"msgbus"`.                                                    |
| `source_parameters` | The parameters for the source element. The provided object is the typical parameters.                          |
| `pipeline`          | The name of the VA Serving pipeline to use (should correspond to a directory in the pipelines directory).      |
| `pipeline_version`  | The version of the pipeline to use. This typically is a subdirectory of a pipeline in the pipelines directory. |
| `publish_frame`     | Boolean flag for whether to publish the meta-data and the analyzed frame, or just the meta-data.               |
| `model_parameters`  | Provides the parameters for the model if DL streamer is being used in the VA Serving pipeline.                 |

### Configuring the Interfaces

The service only supports launching a single pipeline and publishing on a
single topic currently. This means, in the configuration file ("config.json"),
the single JSON object in the `Publisher` list is where the configuration
resides for the published data. See the EII documentation for more details on
the structure of this.

### Configuring EII subscriber and publisher

This service also supports subscribing and publishing messages/frames using the
EIIMessageBus.
The endpoint details for the EII service you need to subscribe from is to be
provided in the **Subscribers** section in [config](config.json) and the endpoints
where you need to publish to are to be provided in **Publishers** section in
[config](config.json).

For enabling injection of frames into the GStreamer pipeline obtained from
EIIMessageBus, please ensure the following changes are done:

    * The source parameter in [config](config.json) is set to msgbus
    ```javascript
       "config": {
           "source": "msgbus"
        }
    ```

    * The template of respective pipeline is set to appsrc as source instead of uridecodebin
    ```javascript
       {
            "type": "GStreamer",
            "template": ["appsrc name=source",
                         " ! rawvideoparse",
                         " ! appsink name=destination"
                        ]
        }
    ```
